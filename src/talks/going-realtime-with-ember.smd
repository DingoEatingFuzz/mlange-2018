It used to be that only the most impressive websites would update data live as you sat on the page.
Now, as the lines between native apps and websites blur, this is becoming expected behavior. What
was once cutting-edge tech is now standard-issue for a good user experience.

See how **HashiCorp** made the UI for the cluster scheduler software Nomad realtime with Ember
Concurrency, Ember Data, and the rendering layer we know and love.

Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a UI engineer at HashiCorp.

---

HashiCorp is a cloud infrastructure automation company.

---

We currently have six products in our product suite. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/),
[Packer](https://packer.io/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/),
[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/), and
[Consul](https://www.consul.io/).

---

The product I work on is Nomad.

---

Nomad is a cluster scheduler, or container orchestrator. It helps you easily deploy applications at
any scale.

---

This isn't a Nomad talk so I'll keep this short, but it helps to know what we're building a UI for.
Within Nomad, there are lots of things going on all the time. Most action is coming from the cluster
itself, but users still want to stay informed. We can't wait on user action to update the state
of the world.

---

One way to do this is to add a refresh button, but that's kind of clunky. Furthermore, it's dated.
The seams are starting to show between the people who build websites and those who use websites.
Any casual web user can look at this refresh button and have a simple questions.

---

Can't it just do that automatically? Twitter telle me about new tweets. My email clients pushes
notifications. Lyft will at least attempt to show me where my ride is. And Spotify will tell me
what my friends are listening to even though I never asked for that and I have never cared.

So why doesn't _your_ web app do that?

---

Everything nodel and great eventually becomes commodity. Great becomes standard. Standard becomes
dated.
