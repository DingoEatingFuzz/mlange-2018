Now that it's been over 10 years since this softly spoken letter was penned by the CEO of the big stick company, the specifics are out of conversation but the impact remains. What I believe to be the generally agreed upon effect of this letter (from my biased perspective as a former Flash developer) is that Apple really didn't want to support Flash on iOS. So, with the help of some generally true words about HTML5, Steve Jobs killed Flash. The influence of Apple and Steve Jobs himself was strong enough that they could bend the future of the web towards an anti-Flash sentiment. Flash, which had pushed the web so much, was now to be seen as the "ok boomer" technology. A stick in the mud and a security nightmare slowing down the march towards an HTML5 utopia.

Since this letter can be seen as the first death of Flash, and the end of life of Flash Player as the second, I think it's fitting to dissect some of the arguments from this [original eulogy](https://web.archive.org/web/20100501010616/https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/).

The letter opens with some general fluffy amicable language, but it gets to the heart of the argument quickly.

> Adobe has characterized our decision as being primarily business driven – they say we want to protect our App Store – but in reality it is based on technology issues.

If you were already on team Apple, this was all you needed to read. Apple has better tech, Adobe is in the past! Anyone who has been in tech long enough knows that it's actually always business driven.

> Adobe claims that we are a closed system, and that Flash is open, but in fact the opposite is true. Let me explain.

A nice false dichotomy. Go on, Steve.

> First, there’s “Open”.
>
> Adobe’s Flash products are 100% proprietary. They are only available from Adobe, and Adobe has sole authority as to their future enhancement, pricing, etc. While Adobe’s Flash products are widely available, this does not mean they are open, since they are controlled entirely by Adobe and available only from Adobe. By almost any definition, Flash is a closed system.

Although Flash Player was and is closed source and proprietary, as mentioned, Adobe and the former Macromedia were involved in standards. They even went as far as donating Tamarin (the ActionScript 3 engine) to the Mozilla Foundation. This proved to not be a very good move since Mozilla has completely neglected it and now their site only contains dead links to mercurial repositories. Fortunately there are forks on GitHub.

> Apple has many proprietary products too. Though the operating system for the iPhone, iPod and iPad is proprietary, we strongly believe that all standards pertaining to the web should be open. Rather than use Flash, Apple has adopted HTML5, CSS and JavaScript – all open standards.

Note that masterfully the topic has changed from the business motive (the App Store being a closed system that Apple maintains total control over) to the open web, which both Apple and Adobe have participated in. Also note the clever use of language above, accusing Flash of being a closed system. Unlike the App Store, Flash isn't a platform. It's a creation tool that exports to a format that is proprietary. There are actually all sorts of standards in the open web that fit this bill that Jobs fails to mention here and Apple was notoriously bad actors in.

First, there is WOFF. The open web font format that Apple just never cared to do anything with. Why? Licensing. Then there's WebP and WebM (and the related open codecs), the open image and movie formats that Apple also ignored. Why? Licensing again. It's not like Apple didn't care about video, as we'll get to later in this letter. Apple even authored the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) standard, but it requires h.264, which in turn requires license fees to the MPEG LA group, of which Apple is a member of. Someone who is truly on the side of tech and open standards doesn't do these things.
