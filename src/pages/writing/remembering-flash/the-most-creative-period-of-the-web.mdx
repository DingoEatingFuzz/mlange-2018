The web has always been a creative place. From the early days of posting textfiles, to webrings, to Flash, to Youtube and MySpace, and to the current trends of social media, much of which is livestreamed and real-time.

I think the root of this creativity has always been accessibility. Never before has there been a planet-scale way to both consume and publish media. Picking a most creative period is futile since the medium has changed so much over the course of this history, but I don't think there can be an argument against the Flash era being the period in which the medium changed the most.

At first, creativity was confined in a small box of technical limitations. Then, as computing power multiplied, operating systems and display technology improved, and the web gained expanded capabilities including plugins, there was creativity in expanding the box.

This was followed by a period of contraction. The web has moved on from being the thing that was exciting to becoming the substrate on which exciting things are hosted. There's no denying there's a near infinite depth of creative videos on TikTok, Instagram, the late Vine, Twitter, Vimeo, Youtube, and elsewhere, but they are all video. Sometimes the video becomes interactive by way of annotations or fourth-wall breaking instructions, but it's still video.

During the peak of Flash, there were no rules--or at least no one cared to follow them. There was also little to no fame chasing (outside of a relatively small circle of Flash professionals making big name websites for big name companies at least). People were just making stuff to make stuff.

In fact, people were making stuff because it was _easy_ to make stuff. It was intoxicatingly easy to make stuff. Making quality stuff was a different story, but the ability to quickly add shapes and keyframes and audio and interactivity, and then see it all come to life upon hitting ctrl+enter was a feedback loop we still haven't recreated in the web platform world of today. And as for quality? Who cares! There was no publishing industry gatekeeping your garbage. Upload it just for fun!

This was also a golden period of time when humans had decades of experience with video but video wasn't an option. We had to have preloaders for content that was only 5MB. Any video was obscenely compressed. We took to vector-based animation instead.

Flash capitalized on this, but it also enabled it. IDEs don't mean the same thing to me as other software engineers. It's hard to consider any environment for development integrated when I still have to bounce around between my "IDE", my web browser, and any number of graphics, video, and audio tools. As mentioned, there was a gap in time between Flash being considered legacy and the web catching up. There has been in even larger gap in the ecosystem of tooling. The closest thing we have is Unity, which in many ways has surpassed Flash in this feedback loop, but it doesn't export websites in the way we expect Flash replacements to. It also isn't the tool you use to make your artwork, but I digress.

I also don't think the loss in tooling alone is what stifled creativity in the web as a medium. Technology changes required a change in how we approached UI. The advent of smart phones and tablets ushered in the responsive web, and the responsive web encouraged immense simplification of form.

This happened at the same time as the semantic web really took off in the wake of HTML5. We collectively revisited the mantra "Don't Make Me Think" and we embraced new ones as well, such as "Content is King". Marshall McLuhan rolls in his grave every time someone preaches this without recognizing that the medium is also content. Just look at Black Mirror: Bandersnatch or the entire discipline of data visualization.

Not that the semantic web has been all bad. With it came more attention to a11y (which Flash supported) and a healthier approach to SEO (which Flash also attempted to support). Maybe it is the fault of tooling that in order to support a11y and SEO properly we often fall back on the safest designs.

There is an argument to be made that the problem is actually deeper than tooling, though. Maybe the platform itself is too restrictive. It's one thing for the platform to have recommendations and good defaults, but the platform can often limit expression. Look at CSS. You can do many wonderful things with it, but isn't it strange that it's a finite set of properties with a finite set of values? Until Houdini, there has been no extensibility of the language. Instead, people have had to resort to tricks, SVG, and canvas. This friction causes people to just not do any of that instead.

The playful culture of experimentation at the heart of the Flash era has largely died out. From time to time we still see some fun portfolio sites or product launch sites, but for the most part we can model the web in markdown; truly the polo shirt and khakis of the interactive web wardrobe.

It doesn't help that publishing on the web has also changed dramatically in the last 15 years. RSS is all but dead, Google will penalize your page rank if you don't hit their bar of usability, Facebook and Google both want to take your content and publish it in their own way on your behalf on their platforms, Safari has a built-in reader mode modeled after services like Readability and Pocket, and the bulk of content consumption happens through the form of social media posts anyway.

What was once the place for new media has because the new medium old media is placed on.

But it's not like the web has lost the ability to support immersive interactive experiences, we have just collectively lost steam. A lot of this energy lives on in art installations, indie games, virtual reality, and related fields. To bring this back to the web, we're going to need to broaden our definition of user experience (and stop listening to all those Google developer advocates that keep trying to convince us that performance is the end all be all of UX), and we're going to need to follow Bret Victor's lead and build better tools.
