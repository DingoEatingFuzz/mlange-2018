> HTML5, the new web standard that has been adopted by Apple, Google and many others, lets web developers create advanced graphics, typography, animations and transitions without relying on third party browser plug-ins (like Flash). HTML5 is completely open and controlled by a standards committee, of which Apple is a member.

Again, mind the date on this. This was simply not true at the time. These were ideas that would eventually be realized, but on May 1st, 2010, this was not true. Meanwhile, Adobe--being a company that makes media creation tools--was also playing in the HTML5 space. Flex and Air were both abstractions over the Flash/ActionScript/MXML ecosystem and supported HTML5 too.

> Apple even creates open standards for the web. For example, Apple began with a small open source project and created WebKit, a complete open-source HTML5 rendering engine that is the heart of the Safari web browser used in all our products. WebKit has been widely adopted. Google uses it for Android’s browser, Palm uses it, Nokia uses it, and RIM (Blackberry) has announced they will use it too. Almost every smartphone web browser other than Microsoft’s uses WebKit. By making its WebKit technology open, Apple has set the standard for mobile web browsers.

More clever writing here. By omitting Adobe's active participation in open standards, the reader is left to assume that Adobe isn't also doing these things. Plus we now know the fate of WebKit: it was so slow in picking up the HTML5 features Jobs uses here to dig Flash's grave with that Google forked it to make Blink, which is now everywhere.

> Second, there’s the “full web”.
>
> Adobe has repeatedly said that Apple mobile devices cannot access “the full web” because 75% of video on the web is in Flash.

Seriously, Jobs' ability to spin words is frighteningly good. The full web would include _all_ Flash content, not just the videos. Flash has always been much larger than video, since it comes from a time when Internet connections were too slow to stream video to begin with. The manipulation of the point here to center video only serves Apple's interests.

> What they don’t say is that almost all this video is also available in a more modern format, H.264, and viewable on iPhones, iPods and iPads. YouTube, with an estimated 40% of the web’s video, shines in an app bundled on all Apple mobile devices, with the iPad offering perhaps the best YouTube discovery and viewing experience ever. Add to this video from Vimeo, Netflix, Facebook, ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, ESPN, NPR, Time, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Sports Illustrated, People, National Geographic, and many, many others. iPhone, iPod and iPad users aren’t missing much video.

Ah, h.264 again. The closed codec that evidently powers "the full web". Glad to see that iOS users get to watch stuff, but the web is much fuller than video consumption.

> Another Adobe claim is that Apple devices cannot play Flash games. This is true. Fortunately, there are over 50,000 games and entertainment titles on the App Store, and many of them are free. There are more games and entertainment titles available for iPhone, iPod and iPad than for any other platform in the world.

Except for the web platform and it's many many many more Flash games? What about that platform?? The full web, remember, you were just talking about it??? Within the span of five paragraphs, the App Store is now a touted platform and not the closed system Jobs accused Flash of being.

> Third, there’s reliability, security and performance.
>
> Symantec recently highlighted Flash for having one of the worst security records in 2009. We also know first hand that Flash is the number one reason Macs crash. We have been working with Adobe to fix these problems, but they have persisted for several years now. We don’t want to reduce the reliability and security of our iPhones, iPods and iPads by adding Flash.

Lots of citation needed here. As I recall, Adobe was quick to patch any security vulnerabilities, and all platforms have security vulnerabilities. There is definitely something to be said about the time delta between a patch being published and that patch being distributed, but this is also not a Flash-specific problem (in 2010 IE6 still had 10% market share, for frame of reference).

> In addition, Flash has not performed well on mobile devices. We have routinely asked Adobe to show us Flash performing well on a mobile device, any mobile device, for a few years now. We have never seen it. Adobe publicly said that Flash would ship on a smartphone in early 2009, then the second half of 2009, then the first half of 2010, and now they say the second half of 2010. We think it will eventually ship, but we’re glad we didn’t hold our breath. Who knows how it will perform?

Flash support was added to Android 2.2, released 21 days after this letter. The whole phrasing of this paragraph is also clearly not about openness. The argument we're supposed to buy into here is that if Flash can't perform well on a mobile device then it's reasonable for Apple to ban us from using it at all. To this day, this is the kind of authority Apple assumes over their app store, but how is this open? The open answer would be to support Flash and pressure Adobe to make it better. Or take the drastic step to disable it by default or ship without it installed by default since it doesn't have a good experience. But to completely ban it from the operating system can in no way be explained as a move inline with a spirit of openness.

> Fourth, there’s battery life.
>
> To achieve long battery life when playing video, mobile devices must decode the video in hardware; decoding it in software uses too much power. Many of the chips used in modern mobile devices contain a decoder called H.264 – an industry standard that is used in every Blu-ray DVD player and has been adopted by Apple, Google (YouTube), Vimeo, Netflix and many other companies.

This one makes my head spin. There's a lot to unpack here. First, note the timing of this note on battery life: the latest iPhone is the 3GS, the successor to the second iPhone, the iPhone 3G. The iPhone 3G was notorious for poor battery life. Some reports had the battery life at under 5 hours a charge with 3G on. So here Jobs manages to aim that visceral pain iPhone users have felt at Flash, a tool that isn't even on iOS. Truly masterful manipulation.

Speaking of manipulation, at this point Flash is synonymous with playing video, apparently.

And then, with the fervor of an Instagram influencer, he plugs h.264 once more. Why only fight Adobe when you can also fight WebM and the open codecs movement. Writing a letter that is loudly in favor of open systems while quietly combatting open systems sounds like the kind of marketing challenge Jobs was made for.

> Fifth, there’s Touch.
>
> Flash was designed for PCs using mice, not for touch screens using fingers. For example, many Flash websites rely on “rollovers”, which pop up menus or other elements when the mouse arrow hovers over a specific spot. Apple’s revolutionary multi-touch interface doesn’t use a mouse, and there is no concept of a rollover.

Everything up to this point was designed for PCs using mice except for the older software that was designed for PCs without mice. Including "the open web". This argument is so flawed. Again, Flash was the heart of innovation on the web. It was where all the new media designers played because they couldn't get enough interaction design. There was so much experimentation to be done. People made Flash games for the Wii and they hacked the Kinect to make augmented reality installations. They wrote their own multitouch libraries before there was a first-party one. Apple's revolutionary multi-touch interface didn't make anyone flinch. It was just another exciting opportunity to try new things. Unfortunately, this new thing meant learning a new language and developing in a much less mature ecosystem.

> If developers need to rewrite their Flash websites, why not use modern technologies like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript?

I have two strong issues with this quip. The first is that any engineer will tell you that redesigns and refactors are much cheaper and safer than complete rewrites. The second is that _we aren't supposed to break the web._ The bigger issue at hand was that swaths of old Flash websites weren't going to be rewritten. They were going to be left behind. And that's what has happened.

> Even if iPhones, iPods and iPads ran Flash, it would not solve the problem that most Flash websites need to be rewritten to support touch-based devices.

This also ignores the early mobile browser innovations that bridged this gap. iOS and Android both went to great lengths to make the web work as well as possible on touch. Smart zooming based on content dimensions, input magnification on tap, hover emulation, etc. There also continue to be all sorts of emulation and remote desktop apps that may not be the most usable, but they still unlock all sorts of use cases that many people would rather do poorly than not do at all.

> Sixth, the most important reason.
>
> Besides the fact that Flash is closed and proprietary, has major technical drawbacks, and doesn’t support touch based devices, there is an even more important reason we do not allow Flash on iPhones, iPods and iPads. We have discussed the downsides of using Flash to play video and interactive content from websites, but Adobe also wants developers to adopt Flash to create apps that run on our mobile devices.
