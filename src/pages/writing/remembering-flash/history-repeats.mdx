These last two sections probably sound oddly familiar. None of the macro forces have changed.

Microsoft's monopoly being the indirect adversary of web standards? All the tech giants are once again in the situation where they are the marketplace and also the product.

Apple playing innocent while quietly throwing developers under the bus and making decisions based purely on their own desires for control and dominance? See Epic v. Apple.

Developing for the web being a minefield of inconsistencies? Well, this has actually gotten a lot better, but the pendulum might be swinging too far in the other direction. We're continuing to sink into a Chromium monoculture.

In the same way that democracy doesn't work unless the people make it work, we can't let the open web become the PR-friendly branding of a tech oligopoly's grander, very much not open, motives.
