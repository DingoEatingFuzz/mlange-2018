HashiCorp is an infrastructure tools company, so even though this was an onsite art installation only running for two days, you know I had to find a way to make this work in the cloud. As mentioned in [the project overview post](../../hashiconf-gen-art-overview/hashiconf-gen-art-overview), this was one of the project goals.
